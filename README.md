# pytest-speed

Modern benchmarking library for python with pytest integration.

`pytest-speed` is mostly backwards compatible with `pytest-benchmark` but adds:
* clearer output using rich
* clearer comparison of benchmarks
* some extra functionality, e.g. running multiple benchmarks from a single test
